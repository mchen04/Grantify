              AI Grant Matching: Beyond Keyword Search

            <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Our AI analyzes your research profile to find relevant grants from NIH, NSF, Grants.gov, and 5+ funding sources. Get personalized matches, not just keyword results.

            <h2>What is AI Grant Matching?</h2>
            <p>
              Unlike simple keyword searches on Grants.gov or NIH Reporter, our AI understands your research context. It analyzes your profile, research area, and past work to match you with relevant opportunities across all federal agencies (NIH, NSF, DOE, EPA, DOD) and major foundationsâ€”finding grants you'd never discover manually.
            </p>

            <h2>How AI Grant Matching Works</h2>
            <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">The AI Matching Process:</h3>
              <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Profile Analysis:</strong> AI analyzes your research area, expertise, and organization type</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Source Search:</strong> Searches NIH, NSF, Grants.gov, DOE, EPA, and foundations simultaneously</li>
                <li><strong>Context Understanding:</strong> Goes beyond keywords to understand grant requirements and your fit</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Ranking:</strong> Presents grants ordered by relevance to your specific profile</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Improves recommendations based on grants you save or apply to</li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <h2>Why AI Matching Beats Traditional Search</h2>
            
            <h3>Find Hidden Opportunities</h3>
            <p>
              Grants.gov has 1,000+ active grants at any time. NIH Reporter shows hundreds more. NSF, DOE, EPA each have their own databases. Our AI searches all simultaneously, finding grants you'd never discover visiting each site separately.
            </p>

            <h3>Understand Grant Fit</h3>
            <p>
              Keywords miss context. Searching "cancer" on NIH might return 500 grants, but which actually fit your specific research? Our AI understands grant requirements, eligibility, and research focus to show only relevant matches.
            </p>

            <h3>Save 40+ Hours Monthly</h3>
            <p>
              Researchers spend 40-60 hours per month searching for grants across multiple sites. Our AI does this in minutes, continuously monitoring all sources for new opportunities matching your profile.
            </p>

            <h2>AI Matching vs Manual Search</h2>
            <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

            <h2>Getting the Most from AI Matching</h2>
            
            <h3>Complete Your Research Profile</h3>
            <p>
              The more our AI knows about your research, the better it matches. Include your field, methodology, target outcomes, and organization type. This helps differentiate between similar-sounding but different grant types.
            </p>

            <h3>Use Both AI and Filters</h3>
            <p>
              Start with AI recommendations, then use filters to refine. For example, AI might find relevant NSF and NIH grants, but you can filter by deadline or funding amount to prioritize.
            </p>

            <h3>Track What Works</h3>
            <p>
              When you save or apply to grants, our AI learns your preferences. Over time, recommendations become more accurate as the system understands which opportunities truly match your needs.
            </p>

            <h2>Real Success with AI Matching</h2>
            
            <h3>Case Study: Cancer Researcher</h3>
            <p>
              Dr. Sarah Chen was spending 10 hours weekly checking NIH, NSF, and foundation sites. Our AI found 3 relevant grants she'd missed: an NSF-NIH joint program, a DOD cancer research grant, and a foundation opportunity. Time saved: 40 hours/month.
            </p>

            <h3>Case Study: Environmental Nonprofit</h3>
            <p>
              Clean Water Alliance only knew about EPA grants. AI matching revealed relevant opportunities from USDA Rural Development, NOAA, and several foundations they'd never heard of. Result: $750K in new funding.
            </p>

            <h3>Case Study: University Lab</h3>
            <p>
              A materials science lab thought they only qualified for NSF grants. AI matching found relevant opportunities from DOE, DOD, NASA, and industry partnerships. Expanded funding pool by 300%.
            </p>
